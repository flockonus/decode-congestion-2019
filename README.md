## Short description

Super simple to use app for carpooling in the city of Vancouver, with the main objective of reducing congestion.
It leverages parking incentives for drivers to pool to work and back to home, and in return earn parking credits.

## Long Description

Using data from Intersection Traffic Counts 2010 to 2017, we sampled 1000 trips and concluded that we could significantly increase car utilization via carpooling/ride-sharing.

We prototyped an innovative carpooling matching recommendation system. We also detailed a multi-stage plan to continuously enhance the machine learning algorithm that is behind the recommendation system.

Our team aim to achieve 2 goals of the hackathon:
+ Ensure a smart and efficient transportation system
+ Prioritize people and goods movement 

Congestion is serious problem that grows year over year in the City of Vancouver. As consequence, road average speed slows down and CO2 emissions increase.

Our solution is an app that is extreme user friendly, and can quickly achieve feasibility on the case of getting the parking incentive approved and the app promoted with the City of Vancouver. This could be a huge case of success for the city transportation system.
